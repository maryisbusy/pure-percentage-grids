Pure Percentage Grids
======================

This is a mashup of [Chris Coyier's "Don't Overthink It Grids"](http://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/), [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/), and [Unsemantic](http://unsemantic.com/). I wanted a pure percentage grid framework, no padding, no gutters. It includes classes to push, pull, prefix, suffix, etc. And it includes mobile and tablet classes to help with changing layout at different viewports.

Mobile First
---------------

Not fully tested "mobile first" stylesheet added.

Gallery Grid
-----------

CSS for an evenly distributed grid, with "small" and "large" rules. [Codepen.io example](http://codepen.io/maryisbusy/pen/lxBei)
